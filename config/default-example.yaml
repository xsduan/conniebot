  # Help string; can be object instead for embed. Object structure should match the EmbedData
  # interface. As of discord.js v14.0.3, this is intentionally undocumented (if you're on the
  # server, see the thread at https://discord.com/channels/222078108977594368/999317051782987797 ).
  # However, the interface is very similar to APIEmbed, which is documented at
  # https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/interface/APIEmbed .

  # additionally, you can use string substitution with `user` and `config` objects
  # supplied, of the User object and configuration respectively. Use like
  # `{foo.bar}` or `{foo[0]}`. (see `utils.strFormat` for more info.)

  # objects will recursively look through values for strings to replace.

    "To add {user.username} to a server, click on the link below:
    \nhttps://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={user.id}&scope=bot&permissions=274878254144
    \nYou may only add the bot to a server that you have the \"manage server\" permission in.
    \n
    \nIt will request the following permissions:
    \n - Read messages
    \n - Send messages in channels
    \n - Send messages in threads
    \n - Embed links
    \n - Read message history
    \n - Add reactions
    \n - Use external emojis
    \n
    \nIn order for the bot to function, at least the \"read messages\" and one of the \"send messages\"
    permissions must be enabled.
    \n\"Embed links\" allows the invite to the testing server to have an embed. It is an optional
    permission.
    \n\"Read message history\" is required to self-react, so for the same reasons as \"add reactions\",
    it is recommended. It also allows the bot to use the Discord reply feature to indicate which message
    it's responding to. 
    \n\"Add reactions\" is used for the {config.deleteEmoji} reaction to delete messages. It's not
    technically required, but I highly recommend enabling it.
    \n\"Use external emojis\" is only used for reacting with {config.pingEmoji} to @\\-mentions. This is
    purely optional, and it doesn't do anything if \"add reactions\" is not enabled."
