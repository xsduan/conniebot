    "To add {user.username} to a server, click on the link below:\n
    https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={user.id}&scope=bot&permissions=274878188608\n
    You may only add the bot to a server that you have the \"manage server\" permission in.\n
    \n
    It will request the following permissions:\n
    - Read messages\n
    - Send messages in channels\n
    - Send messages in threads\n
    - Embed links\n
    - Add reactions\n
    - Use external emojis\n
    \n
    In order for the bot to function, at least the \"read messages\" and one of the \"send messages\"
    permissions must be enabled.\n
    \"Embed links\" allows the invite to the testing server to have an embed. It is an optional
    permission.\n
    \"Add reactions\" is used for the 🗑️ reaction to delete messages. It's not technically required,
    but I highly recommend enabling it.\n
    \"Use external emojis\" is only used for reacting with {config.pingEmoji} to @\\-mentions. This is
    purely optional, and it doesn't do anything if \"add reactions\" is not enabled."

  # currently absolute timeout is 2048 because the largest field is 2048
  # characters long, and the longest normal message is only allowed to be 2000
  # characters (I think?) however if you really wanted to you could set it
  # farther, but you'll have some rejections from the api server. (or you
  # somehow purchased an override from Discord)
